So everyone knows what's going on. If someone gets sent to Azkaban, do a story on it! Keep the readers entertained, and keep them up on events happening around the game.  You don't need to report every thing such as : So and So got muted today!  - That's not important.  Things that relate to the game are really wanted, if it has to do with real life, then please leave it out.<p>Editors/Story Creators - You are to write in the paper about events that the Reporters tell you, or the news you come across, yourself. <p>Reporters - Your job is to find out juicy news, like if someone got sent to Azkaban, you would report back to myself or an Editor and we will put it into the Prophet. <p>More verbs coming soon. I JUST thought of this and coded. Still in the works. Enjoy.  <p><font color=aqua>"
